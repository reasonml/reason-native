Record field [31m[1mhelo[22m[39m can't be found in any record type. Did you mean [33mhello[39m?

Record fields must be "in scope". That means you need to `open TheModule` where the record type is defined.
Alternatively, instead of opening a module, you can prefix the record field name like {TheModule.x: 0, y: 100}.
